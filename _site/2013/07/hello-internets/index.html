	<p>As many in the industry know, when you start learning a new language or framework, you usually create a very simple application that just outputs the text ‘Hello World’.  Well, this is my first official blog post and my take on the traditional ‘Hello, World’. </p>

<p>I have been considering creating a blog about web development for a while now but I kept finding excuses for making that not happen. I told myself that I didn’t have anything original to say, that I didn’t know enough or that no one would read, it so why waste my time.  I knew this was not necessarily true but I would continue to preach this to myself. </p>

<p>I received the inspiration to get over this negativity from <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry" target="_blank">Harry Roberts</a> of <a href="http://csswizardry.com" target="_blank">csswizardry.com</a>. I decided to contact Harry when I realized he was only one year older than myself, but had already set himself up as a well-respected name in the web development world.</p>

<p>I sent him an email, not fully expecting a response, but I received one with some excellent advice.  His first point was,<div class="island"><blockquote> “Have ideas, write about them. The key is getting stuff written down under your own name.” </blockquote></div>   This poignant advice resonated very deeply with me. He expanded on this point saying, <div class="island"><blockquote>“I have friends far, far cleverer than me, but no one knows who they are. The reasons for this are usually that they don’t even have a blog, never mind use it. Write everything down, you never know who’ll happen upon it”.</blockquote></div>  </p>

<p>So this is me, creating a blog where I can write down my ideas, share my experiences, and hopefully help some people out who are getting started. </p>

<p>Oh and thanks for the advice, Harry!</p>
