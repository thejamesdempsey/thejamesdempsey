	<p>This site is designed as a place for me to write about CSS, HTML, maintenance and other topics as well. I work as a developer for Cru, one of the largest non-profit organizations in the United States, at their headquarters in Florida.</p>
	<p>I specialize in writing personalized code for websites and web apps, with a focus on CSS, HTML, Javascript for creating powerful web solutions. I love interacting with many different web technologies. Currently I am playing with Ruby, Jekyll and SASS Mixins</p>
	
	
	<h3  class="line-break"><span>SmartClickr</span></h3>
	<p><a href="http://smartclickr.com" alt="smartclickr.com" target="_blank">SmartClickr</a>, a project I built with 3 classmates this past year, is an all-in-one audience response system build to help facilitate better communication with a speaker and audience members. It is a web app built to run on any internet connected device. It is super easy and fun to use and it is built on Node.js so it is lighting quick. The responses from the audience grow on charts in real-time. You should really check it out, it will rock your socks!</p>
	
	
	<h3  class="line-break"><span>Contact</span></h3>
	<p>If you would like to chat feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@thejamesdempsey.com">send me an email</a>. It is my goal to respond to every email I receive, but if it takes me a while to respond don't hesitate to follow up.  </p>
	<p>You can also <a href="http://twitter.com/thejamesdempsey">send me a tweet</a> if you like. I am currently accepting freelance work on a case-by-case basis.</p>
